# Programming Languages Learning Repository

This repository serves as a collection of code and files developed during the process of learning multiple programming languages. Each language has its dedicated folder containing code samples, projects, and learning resources.

## Languages

The repository currently includes the following programming languages:

- JavaScript
- Golang
- HTML&CSS
- WebDevelopment(ongoing)

Each language has its own dedicated folder within the repository structure. You can explore the code and files in each language-specific folder to find examples, projects, and additional learning resources.

Feel free to browse the code, experiment, modify, and extend it to deepen your understanding of the languages.

Happy learning!
