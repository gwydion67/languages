                Nowadays although the price of storage disks have become significantly lower, at the same time the size of the files keeps on increasing.
                <br>
                Managing disk space is essential for maintaining the performance and efficiency of your devices. Over time, your laptop, mobile devices, and other computing devices can accumulate unnecessary files and data, which can lead to storage constraints and sluggish performance.

                Before diving into disk space management, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of your operating system and the file system used on your devices.
                Additionally, knowing how to navigate through the device's file explorer or terminal will be beneficial.

                    Let's start with the OS which is most commonly used. <br>
                    There are quite few available utilities for cleaning up un-important files.

                            If you don't mind an old-school interface, the classic Disk Cleanup tool gets the cleaning job done. Access it by typing <b>Disk Cleanup</b> into the Start menu and selecting the disk you want to clean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a moment, you'll see a list of unnecessary files that Windows can clean up. Assuming you're an administrator, you should first click the <b>Clean up system files</b>
                            button to scan again for additional types of data.

                            you can pretty much delete all the files shown here specially cleaning up old windows version can relieve a lot of load on you drive.
                            <strong>Previous Windows installation(s)</strong>If you've recently updated to a new major version of Windows, you'll see a  entry.

                        <p>
                            Deleting this will remove the old files that Windows keeps for 10 days‚Äîthose allow you to easily go back to an earlier version. You should also avoid removing the <strong>Windows ESD installation files</strong> option, as this is used for resetting your PC via Settings.

                            You can use the Storage Sense feature found there to automatically clean up files when your disk space is low, or every so often.

            <p>This concludes our discussion for windows.. most operating systems will have most of these in common and almost all these steps should be similar.
                Instead lets look what other OS has extra things that we can clean and some methods that are different from the above.
