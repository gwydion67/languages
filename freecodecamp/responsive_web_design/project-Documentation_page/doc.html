                Let's start with the OS which is most commonly used. <br>
                There are quite few available utilities for cleaning up un-important files.
                <h3>Step 1: Erase Temporary junk</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <header class="method">Disk Cleanup</header>
                        <p class="detail">
                            If you don't mind an old-school interface, the classic Disk Cleanup tool gets the cleaning job done. Access it by typing <b>Disk Cleanup</b> into the Start menu and selecting the disk you want to clean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a moment, you'll see a list of unnecessary files that Windows can clean up. Assuming you're an administrator, you should first click the <b>Clean up system files</b>
                            button to scan again for additional types of data.
                            <div class="img_div">

                            </div>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            you can pretty much delete all the files shown here specially cleaning up old windows version can relieve a lot of load on you drive.
                            <strong>Previous Windows installation(s)</strong>If you've recently updated to a new major version of Windows, you'll see a  entry. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Deleting this will remove the old files that Windows keeps for 10 days‚Äîthose allow you to easily go back to an earlier version. You should also avoid removing the <strong>Windows ESD installation files</strong> option, as this is used for resetting your PC via Settings.

                            Windows 10 and Windows 11 both include much of this same functionality of Disk Cleanup, with a nicer interface, at <b>Settings > System > Storage</b>.
                            You can use the Storage Sense feature found there to automatically clean up files when your disk space is low, or every so often. 
                            Click <b>Configure Storage Sense or run it now</b>(on Windows 10) to change these options.
